# What is an ArrayList? #
For this class, an ArrayList is internally a [doubly linked list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly-linked_list) which is treated like an array. This ArrayList can have items added to the list without being slow and inefficient.

I will admit, the whole idea of me creating this ArrayList came from Java and their ArrayList class, C++ doesn't seem to have the same thing readily available, so I have created one for anyone to use.

## Where can I get this ArrayList? ##
You will be able to access the ArrayList code in our [repository](http://code.google.com/p/arraylist/source/browse/#svn/trunk).
